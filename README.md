1. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why? 
> I think using the MongoLabs Data API was really easy. We just had to insert the api key from the mongolabs page.

2. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
> Parsing the data was easy. But displaying each element of data was a bit difficult. There was some strong logic needed there.

3.If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern? 
> I think JQuery is a very powerful tool. Using application and Data API's is a very easy way to interact with the applications and data. I would use Ruby on Rails as my web development framework as it provides lot of flexibility for all kinds of developers.
